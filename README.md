# DESCRIPTION
A number input like a SpinBox in Godot, but better suited for mobile swipe gestures. Includes label for test description of the input.

# INSTALLATION
This isn't technically a Godot Plugin, it doesn't use the special Plugin features of the Editor, so don't put it inside the "addon" folder. The folder of the tool can be anywhere else you want, though, but I suggest having it in a "modules" folder.

After that, the «class_name DragSpinBox» registers the tool so you can add it to a project like you add any Godot node.

# USAGE
Works pretty much like SpinBox, but you drag on the element to change value, and it only works on integers.
